### Hola ! <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1303154/88677602-1635ba80-d120-11ea-84d8-d263ba5fc3c0.gif" width="24px" alt="hi">

Hi, I'm German Moreyra, a .NET developer with a focus on backend technologies.

In my free time, I like to explore new technologies. I'm also committed to continuous learning and staying up-to-date with industry trends and best practices.
I believe that collaboration and knowledge-sharing are key to becoming a better developer, and I'm always looking for opportunities to learn from others.

If you're interested in working together or have any questions about my experience, feel free to contact me. You can also check out my GitHub profile to see some of the projects I've worked on.
